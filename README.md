Before running bot.py Make sure you launch your terminal in that folder and run " pip install -r requirements.txt"
Then Open bot.py with notepad/vscode/notepad++ (whatever u want)
And change the following:
TOKEN = 'PASTE YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE'
AUTHORIZED USERS = {
YOUR_USERID_HERE, YOUR_FRIEND_USERID_HERE
}
LOCKDOWN_MASTER = YOUR_USERID_HERE
Btw you dont have to include your friend in authorized USERS you can just. add yourself
